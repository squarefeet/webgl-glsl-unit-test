## What is it?

An easy-to-use set of helper methods to allow you to write unit tests for your WebGL GLSL code. GLSL isn't the easiest thing to debug, and whilst there are tools out there, there aren't any specifically for WebGL (that I could find at least).

See the [Getting Started](./GettingStarted.md) guide for more information.
